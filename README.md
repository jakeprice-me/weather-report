# Weather Report

A personal script that uses the [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) API to send a daily weather report to [Gotify](https://gotify.net/).

## Usage

The script needs a trigger to run at a certain time. I run the script at 7am every morning via a cron job.

```sh
0 7 * * * cd weather-report/ && /usr/bin/python3 weather-report/main.py
```

## Configuration File

You must create a file named `config.yml` which contains _real_ key/values below. An example file named `config_template.yml` is also provided in the repository.

## Output

The script will send a message in the following format to a Gotify app specified in `config.yml`.
